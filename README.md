# fancy-tabs

This is an implementation of [fancy-tabs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom) by [Eric Bidelman](https://developers.google.com/web/resources/contributors#ericbidelman)
View the linked shadowdom page for tag/component details

## What is different from Eric Bidelman implamentation then? 
Not much, this implementations dependencies are checked into github, so the component can be called from another domain across the web directly from the repository.
